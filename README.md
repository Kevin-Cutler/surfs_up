## Overview and Purpose
__________________________

I am working on gathering information for my business partner/investor who has agreed to go into business with my on the island Oahu. W. Avy is an investor who is well known for his love of surfing and has partenered with me on the surf and shake shop business. Due to W.Avys previous experience which involved a surf shop which was put out of business, W. Avy is has explained how key research into the weather in the area is for our business. Our surf and shake shop will serve shakes and surfboards to tourist and the locals in the area. Specifically, Mr. Avy wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu.This will help us plan our straegy and determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.


## Analysis and Results

* Determine the Summary Statistics for June
_____________________________________________

From the data below I see that the average temperature for the month of June show a average of 75 degrees. Looking at the data this seems like pleasant weather but for a Surf and Shakes shop it seems slightly low for a beach environment. I dont have complete doubts but it is presenting to me the need to further investigate to convey a more compeling success story. The maximum temperate is 85 degrees which averages 80 degrees when viewed together with the average of 75. The minimum temperateure shows to be 64 degrees so this is concerning. I would need to further investigate the chance of rain during these months as well to determine if there is a high chance of percipitation to help support a decision.


* Determine the Summary Statistics for December
_____________________________________________

From the data below I see that the average temperature for the month of December show a average of 71 degrees. Looking at the data this is concerning. When I think of weather for a Surf and Shakes shop I think of temperateures in the 80s to be ideal for time spent in the sun and at the beach. I know that if this is concerning for me this data presented to W. Avy will be even worst when I think about his past failure due to poor weather. The maximum temperate for December is 83 degrees which is only 2 degrees less than June. The average of Decembers max and average is 77 degrees. The minimum temperateure shows to be 56 degrees so this is even more concerning than June. The total average looks at the Min, Average, and Max for December is 70 degrees. This is extremely concerning and I would need to investogate percipitation to help support a decision as well.



# Summary:
________________________________________

In conclusion there seems to be positive supportive data if we only review the temperatures for the months of June and December. This will provide some good data to be reviewed with W. Avy before making the final decision to move forward with the business. I would also look into expansion into other months or year round to counter poor performance in June and December to make up for loss revenue.


### Additional analysis to perform to gather more weather data for June and December.
_______________________________________________

1. I would look at the frequency or corellation between low temperature and high percipitation for these two months as well.
2. To be certain about this buisness venture I would also review the probability of precipitation for these two months.

## Differences in weather between June and December
____________________________________________________

* The Min temperateure in June is 64 degrees and Decembers Min temperateure is 56 degrees 8 degrees lower and this is concerning and would provide confidence with supporting data on       perciitation.
* The Avg temperature in June is 75 degrees and Decembers Avg is 71 degrees 4 degrees lower than June.
* The Max temperate in June 85 degrees is 2 degrees higher than December which is 83 degrees which is good because there is a small variance.
